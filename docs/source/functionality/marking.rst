Marking images
======================

Marks can be placed in any of 9 groups. The user can place a mark by pressing any number between 1 and 9. Pressing each number will place a mark at the location of the cursor, and in the group associated with that number. The names of each group can be modified in **Edit > Settings**. Once a mark is placed, its pixel coordinates, WCS coordinates (if applicable), group, label, the name of the image associated with the mark, and the current date are all saved into ``$USERNAME_marks.txt``, where ``$USERNAME`` is the username of the user's profile on their computer. The label of the mark can be modified simply by clicking on the label of the mark, and typing. Pressing enter, or clicking outside the label, will save this information into the same text file.
