Categorizing and commenting
#####################

The user can also categorize images and enter comments for the image. Images can be placed into any number of 5 categories. These categories are listed as checkboxes at the bottom panel of Image Marker; clicking these checkboxes will place the image in that category. Also in the bottom panel, comments can be entered for the current image. This information is saved in the save directory in a file named ``$USERNAME_images.txt``. The user can also click the heart button on the far right of the bottom panel, which will add the image to the user's favorites. A list of favorited images is saved in ``$USERNAME_favorites.txt``.
